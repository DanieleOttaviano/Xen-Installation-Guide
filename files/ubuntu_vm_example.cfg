# Example PV Linux guest configuration
# =====================================================================
## This is a fairly minimal example of what is required for a
# Paravirtualised Linux guest. For a more complete guide see xl.cfg(5)

# Guest name
name = "ubuntu_vm"

# 128-bit UUID for the domain as a hexadecimal number.
# Use "uuidgen" to generate one if required.
# The default behavior is to generate a new UUID each time the guest is started.
#uuid = "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Kernel image to boot
kernel = "/root/vmlinuz"

# Ramdisk (optional)
ramdisk = "/root/initrd.gz"

# Initial memory allocation (MB)
memory = 1024

# Number of VCPUS
vcpus = 2

# Network devices
# A list of 'vifspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-network-configuration.markdown
vif = ['bridge=xenbr0']

# Disk Devices
# A list of `diskspec' entries as described in
# docs/misc/xl-disk-configuration.txt
#disk = [ '/dev/vg/guest-volume,raw,xvda,rw' ]
disk = [ '/dev/vg0/lv_vm_ubuntu,raw,xvda,rw' ]

# it depends on the xen version installed (Check the XEN version before launching xl create)
# bootloader = "/usr/lib/xen-4.14/bin/pygrub"
